# MorphosyntacticLearning

This is the code that accompanies the following study: *Incidental L2 morphosyntactic learning in dialogue: The acquisition of stem-vowel alternations in German strong verbs by native speakers of Dutch*.

At the moment, the article is still in preparation, but a poster summarising the results can be found [here](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/325334910_Incidental_learning_of_L2_morphosyntax_from_spoken_input_during_a_simulated_conversation).

Johanna de Vos wrote `Statistical_models.R`.

Statistical_models.R contains a series of generalised linear mixed-effects models that are used to investigate the acquisition of grammar in a second language.
